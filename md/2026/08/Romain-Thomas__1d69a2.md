## Introduction

[DexProtector](https://licelus.com/products/dexprotector) is a comprehensive security solution providing a complete set of features to protect mobile apps (Android/iOS) against different threats including reverse engineering and malware.

Its core capabilities include:

-   Obfuscation, Encryption, and Virtualization
-   RASP (Runtime Application Self-Protection)
-   Anti-Tampering and Integrity Control

This protector renewed my interest when I noticed that [Revolut](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.revolut.revolut) is using this solution to protect their apps. Interestingly, I also found that the solution was used by [Live Net TV](https://www.romainthomas.fr/post/26-01-dexprotector/img/livenet.png), a dubious IPTV application.

This post synthesizes my findings from a deep dive into DexProtector.

You can download the original LiveNet APK for reference here: [com.playnet.androidtv.ads.5.0.1.apk](https://www.romainthomas.fr/post/26-01-dexprotector/assets/com.playnet.androidtv.ads.5.0.1.apk) [1](#fn:1)

## Bootstrap

DexProtector uses a complex loading chain designed to hinder static/dynamic analysis and memory dumping.

It all starts with a custom class named `Protected<suffix>` which is injected in the main package of the application and referenced in the `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:versionCode="56"
    android:versionName="5.0.1"
    package="com.playnet.androidtv.ads">
  <application
    android:name="com.playnet.androidtv.ProtectedLiveNetTV">
  </application>
</manifest>
```

This class is involved in various stages of DexProtector but first, it is used to load a native library: `libdpboot.so`:

```java
package com.playnet.androidtv;

public class ProtectedLiveNetTV extends Application {
  @Override
  protected void attachBaseContext(Context context) {
      super.attachBaseContext(context);
      try {
          DeFcpynjg(); // Basic integrity check
          System.loadLibrary("dpboot");
          oagfhBoAe(); // Load libdexprotector.so (or libdexprotector_h.so)
      } catch (Throwable th) {
          ProtectedLiveNetTV$R$id.EfxsfkH(this, th);
      }
  }
}
```

`libdpboot.so` serves multiple purposes, one of which is loading `libdexprotector.so`. `libdexprotector.so` is loaded by a Java native function (named `oagfhBoAe` in the previous example) that uses the JNI to call `System.loadLibrary("dexprotector")`.

`libdexprotector.so` is a custom ELF loader [2](#fn:2) that is responsible for decrypting and mapping the final protected payload into memory.

This protected payload is embedded within the library itself:

In some versions of DexProtector, the beginning of the packed library can be identified by looking for the magic bytes: `DPLF`:

```hexdump

```

In other versions, the payload is located in the last `PT_LOAD` segment:

```bash
-> revolut-10-109 git:(main) ✗ readelf -lW ./libdexprotector.so

Elf file type is DYN (Shared object file)

   +------------ Packed library
```

The most clever aspect of `libdexprotector.so` is how it derives the 32-byte key that is used to decrypt the payload.

It uses a static salt located in its library but it also uses the **runtime state** of the system linker.

The key is partially derived from the assembly code of the linker function `rtld_db_dlactivity()`.

By default, `rtld_db_dlactivity()` is an empty function (i.e. a `ret`). However, when `frida-server` is used, it hooks this function by injecting a “trampoline” It is worth mentioning that this trampoline is persistent even if `frida-server` is no longer running. This means that if `frida-server` runs at least **once**, the key will be corrupted by the **persistent** trampoline.

Consequently, the second stage won’t be executed

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zhiyu-zeng/img@main/img/2026/08/e66a516a88ca1967.webp)

Given the correct computed key, `libdexprotector.so` decrypts the beginning of the payload, which starts with a header followed by ELF-like segments describing the content to be mapped into memory.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zhiyu-zeng/img@main/img/2026/08/7d74dba4b6fad7d4.webp)

The unpacked library was originally named `libdp.so`. It is worth mentioning that neither the packed nor the unpacked library contains the original ELF header.

Instead, `libdexprotector.so` acts as a custom ELF loader that relies on its own custom header rather than using the official `Elf64_Ehdr` structure. Similarly, the segments table uses a custom structure to represent the segments that need to be mapped in memory.

When `libdexprotector.so` has finished mapping the protected-packed library, it jumps to the function referenced in the `DT_FINI_ARRAY` entry of the protected library.

Info

During the loading phase, `libdexprotector.so` clears the different regions referenced in the dynamic table. For instance, the relocations table referenced in the `DT_ANDROID_RELA` entry is cleared with zeros once `libdexprotector.so` has processed the relocations.

This means that if attackers try to dump the protected library after it has fully loaded, they will miss critical information from the dynamic table.

## libdp.so

The protected library loaded through `libdexprotector.so` is a key component to understand most of the DexProtector’s security features.

It contains the RASP detections, the engine to load encrypted classes, the logic to load protected `assets/` etc. It’s a masterpiece of engineering and different detections are very juicy.

From a cryptography perspective, it uses various algorithms and everything is implemented following standards and good practices. In addition, DexProtector uses a highly context-sensitive approach to generate and derive key material.

## Key Derivation

One of the purposes of `libdp.so` is to generate a 32-byte master key. This key is critical, as it is used to derive the subkeys necessary for various security features, such as asset decryption.

To ensure integrity, the master key is generated using specific elements that create a strong cryptographic binding to the host application.

These elements typically include:

-   The APK signature
-   Unprotected DEX files
-   The DexProtector configuration (embedded within `libdp.so`)

Because of this binding, even minimal static or dynamic modifications to the APK will result in a corrupted master key, preventing the application from executing correctly.

The key derivation process also uses the content of `libdp.so` to derive or corrupt the key. This acts as an anti-tampering measure: if an attacker attempts to hook or instrument functions within `libdp.so`, the resulting key will be invalid.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zhiyu-zeng/img@main/img/2026/08/49df806d7df85dc2.webp)

In theory, this design is robust. However, while it was challenging, I managed to develop a workaround to instrument and hook `libdp.so` without triggering these corruption mechanisms.

Ultimately, I was able to generate the valid master key without executing the protected applications (e.g., Revolut, Kaspersky). With this master key, it is straightforward to derive the subkeys required to decrypt assets and access DexProtector’s proprietary files, such as:

-   `se.dat`
-   `resources.dat`
-   `mm.dat`
-   `dp.mp3`
-   `classes.dex.dat`
-   `ic.dat`
-   `ct.dat`
-   `rcdb.dat`

## Class Encryption

One of the major features provided by DexProtector is the ability to encrypt classes.

As detailed in the official documentation [3](#fn:3), this is configured by defining the target classes or packages within the `<classEncryption>` tag:

```xml
<classEncryption>
    <filters>
        <filter>glob:com/mypackage/**</filter>
    </filters>
</classEncryption>
```

Internally, DexProtector protects all `classes<N>.dex` files that match the classes or packages defined in the configuration. For instance, protecting the packages `com/mypackage` and `com/iptv` may require DexProtector to protect the entire `classes.dex` and `classes2.dex`.

The protected DEX files are bundled into a single file located in `assets/classes.dex.dat`. This file contains the encrypted and compressed DEX data, along with a header located at the end of the file. At runtime, the protection works by decrypting and decompressing the given DEX files and then using internal Android APIs to dynamically load the clear DEX files from memory.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zhiyu-zeng/img@main/img/2026/08/a35cb048b4eb410f.webp)

Note that DexProtector implements an anti-dump mechanism to prevent an attacker from extracting the clear DEX file from memory. This mechanism works by unmapping [4](#fn:4) unused regions of the in-memory DEX files.

For instance, consider that the plain `classes.dex` is mapped in the memory region `[0x60000, 0x70000]` and that DexProtector unmaps the unused region `[0x64000, 0x68000]`. If an attacker tries to dump the whole range `[0x60000, 0x70000]`, it will trigger a `SEGV_MAPERR` because the region `[0x64000, 0x68000]` is unmapped.

Nevertheless, this protection can be defeated to access the “unprotected” DEX files:

**`com.playnet.androidtv.ads - assets/classes.dex.dat`**

-   [classes0.decrypted.dex](https://www.romainthomas.fr/post/26-01-dexprotector/assets/classes0.decrypted.dex)
-   [classes1.decrypted.dex](https://www.romainthomas.fr/post/26-01-dexprotector/assets/classes1.decrypted.dex)
-   [classes2.decrypted.dex](https://www.romainthomas.fr/post/26-01-dexprotector/assets/classes2.decrypted.dex)
-   [classes3.decrypted.dex](https://www.romainthomas.fr/post/26-01-dexprotector/assets/classes3.decrypted.dex)

When we open these unprotected DEX files, we notice that some classes exhibit obfuscated code:

```java
package com.playnet.androidtv;

import android.content.BroadcastReceiver;
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;


public class BootReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    @Override // android.content.BroadcastReceiver
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        Object objI;
        try {
            Object objI2 = LibLiveNetTV.i(1263, intent);
            if (objI2 == null ||
                !LibLiveNetTV.i(0, objI2, ProtectedLiveNetTV.s("\u5a7d")) ||
                !LibLiveNetTV.i(440, LibLiveNetTV.i(666, context),
                    LibLiveNetTV.i(3238, context, 2131951803), false) ||
                (objI = LibLiveNetTV.i(567, LibLiveNetTV.i(2489, context),
                                       LibLiveNetTV.i(1465, context))) == null)
            {
                return;
            }
            LibLiveNetTV.i(904, objI, 268435456);
            LibLiveNetTV.i(1054, context, objI);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            LibLiveNetTV.i(69, e);
        }
    }
}
```

This output demonstrates the presence of two additional security layers: string encryption and indirect method/field access (invocation hiding).

## String Encryption

As described in the official documentation, developers can protect sensitive strings by applying the `<stringEncryption>` tag in their configuration:

```xml
<stringEncryption>
    <filters>
        <filter>glob:!**/**</filter>
        <filter>glob:com/test/**</filter>
    </filters>
</stringEncryption>
```

From an implementation perspective, this protection works by replacing sensitive strings with calls to a native function. This function accepts an encoded index (passed as a string) to retrieve the original string.

Consider the following example:

```java
public class BootReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
    @Override // android.content.BroadcastReceiver
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        // ...
        String clear = ProtectedLiveNetTV.s("\u5a7d");
        // ...
    }
}
```

In this example, the native function is `ProtectedLiveNetTV.s`, and the index is `0x5a7d` (represented by the character `\u5a7d`).

The native function `ProtectedLiveNetTV.s(String enc)` is implemented within the library `libdp.so` and the decryption process operates as follows:

-   **Lookup**: The function uses the external `assets/se.dat` file to convert the input index (`0x5a7d`) into a file offset.
    
-   **Retrieval**: This offset points to the specific location of `se.dat`.
    
-   **Decryption**: `ProtectedLiveNetTV.s` decrypts the data found at that offset and returns the plain-text string using a standard cryptography algorithm and a custom one.
    

The algorithm used to decrypt the strings relies on a specific key and a nonce constructed using a combination of:

1.  The string index (e.g., `0x5a7d`).
2.  The hash code of the calling class (e.g., `com.playnet.androidtv.BootReceiver`).

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zhiyu-zeng/img@main/img/2026/08/e2ca45acb00fbc88.webp)  

After that, we get the clear string `android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED`.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zhiyu-zeng/img@main/img/2026/08/4506e163df7e552e.webp)  

Info

DexProtector adds an additional layer of security by binding the decryption logic to the memory address of the native function itself.

The internal crypto context used for decryption is masked using the address of `ProtectedLiveNetTV.s`. This acts as an integrity check: if an attacker attempts replace the function during `env->RegisterNative`, the memory address will not match. Consequently, the unmasking process will fail, the crypto context will be corrupted, and the string will not decrypt correctly.

## Method & Field Access Protection

The second layer of protection focuses on obfuscating method calls and field access. This process involves transforming these operations into native invocations.

```diff
- context.getPackageName()
+ LibLiveNetTV.i(1465, context)
```

Similar to string encryption, developers can use the `<hideAccess>` tag to apply this protection to specific packages and classes defined in the filters:

```xml
<hideAccess>
    <filters>
        <filter>glob:!**/**</filter>
        <filter>glob:com/test/**</filter>
    </filters>
</hideAccess>
```

When an instruction requires protection, DexProtector replaces it with a call to a native bridge function (e.g., `LibLiveNetTV.i(...)`). This function accepts an index as the first parameter, followed by any arguments required by the original method or field.

This index is used to resolve the targeted method or field thanks to the asset file `assets/dp.mp3`. This file is decrypted and decompressed during the DexProtector’s initialization routine and it contains the information to make the relationship between indexes and the hidden methods or fields.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zhiyu-zeng/img@main/img/2026/08/26e3396d76d90bd1.webp)  

The layout of the data file is divided into four distinct sections:

**Header**

Contains integrity hashes and the number of elements in the subsequent sections.

**Elements Array**

An array of structures describing the hidden methods and fields. Each element contains references to:

-   The name (e.g., `getPackageName`)
-   The signature (e.g., `()Ljava/lang/String;`)
-   The defining class (e.g., `android/content/Context`)

**Classes Array**

An array listing the class names that own the elements in the previous section. Note that this is not an array of strings, but an array of integers serving as references into the Strings Pool.

**Strings Pool**

A collection of all string literals referenced by the previous sections.

Using the previous example, `LibLiveNetTV.i(1465, context)`:

1.  The native function `LibLiveNetTV.i` whose implementation is located in `libdp.so` takes the index `1465`.
2.  This number is used as an index into the *Elements Array* of `dp.mp3`
3.  It resolves the mapping to: `android/content/Context.getPackageName() - ()Ljava/lang/String;`

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zhiyu-zeng/img@main/img/2026/08/8fb877c65b7b28e0.webp)  

Then, it executes the function via the JNI:

```cpp
jclass clazz = env->FindClass("android/content/Context");
jmethodID mid = env->GetMethodID(clazz, "getPackageName", "()Ljava/lang/String;");
return env->CallObjectMethod(context, mid);
```

## Recovery

Based on our understanding of the string encryption and hidden access mechanisms, we can now strip the protections from the different DEX files using [Redex](https://github.com/facebook/redex).

Redex is a DEX bytecode optimizer that provides a reliable framework for reading, writing, and analyzing `.dex` files. It also offers facilities to orchestrate and configure passes and performing both type inference and abstract interpretation. These features make it the ideal tool to strip these protections.

To achieve this, we create two custom passes, one targeting each protection mechanism:

```json
{
  "redex" : {
    "passes" : [
      "StringEncryption",
      "RecoverHiddenAccess",

      "PeepholePass",
      "ConstantPropagationPass",
      "ResultPropagationPass",

      "RegAllocPass",
      "CopyPropagationPass",
      "LocalDcePass",

      "ReduceGotosPass"
     ]
  },
  "RecoverHiddenAccess": {
    "info": "/home/romain/research/dexprotector/livenet/dp.mp3"
  },
  "StringEncryption": {
    "se_dat_file": "/home/romain/research/dexprotector/livenet/se.dat.clear"
  },
}
```

These passes work by identifying calls to the obfuscation wrappers, specifically `ProtectedLiveNetTV.s()` or `LibLiveNetTV.i()`. The system then replaces these calls with the recovered data:

1.  Strings are restored using the `se.dat` file.
2.  Methods/Fields are restored using the `dp.mp3` file.

The output is an unprotected DEX file.

![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zhiyu-zeng/img@main/img/2026/08/e2b709c0601fa6d6.webp)  

To verify the effectiveness of the Redex approach, you can compare the files below:

-   **Before Redex:** [classes2.decrypted.dex](https://www.romainthomas.fr/post/26-01-dexprotector/assets/classes2.decrypted.dex)
-   **After Redex:** [classes2.unprotected.dex](https://www.romainthomas.fr/post/26-01-dexprotector/assets/classes2.unprotected.dex)

This Redex-based deobfuscation approach has been successfully tested on other applications secured by DexProtector (examples below).

Info

It is worth mentioning that this app, which has been downloaded over 10 million times, uses weak `DES/ECB-MD5` cipher suite along with clear and **explicit** `http://` communications. (c.f., `network-security-config.xml`)

## Assets Protections

Sensitive application data is often stored within files attached to the APK/XAPK. These assets can include certificates, images, Machine Learning models, or serialized keystores. DexProtector provides a means to protect these embedded resources.

According to the documentation, asset protection can be configured using the following structure:

```xml
<resourceEncryption>
    <assets>
        <filters>
            <filter>glob:cert/**</filter>
        </filters>
    </assets>
    <res>
        <filters>
            <filter>glob:raw/**</filter>
        </filters>
    </res>
    <root>
        <filters>
            <filter>glob:fonts/**</filter>
        </filters>
    <strings>
        <filters>
            <filter>my_api_key</filter>
            <filter>glob:mobile_token*</filter>
            <filter>glob:payments_**</filter>
            <filter>glob:sensitive_strings_arrays_etc*</filter>
        </filters>
    </strings>

To demonstrate this protection, I will analyze the application [com.dexprotector.detector.envchecks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dexprotector.detector.envchecks). The `.xapk` can be downloaded here: [`com.dexprotector.detector.envchecks.2.1.xapk`](https://www.romainthomas.fr/post/26-01-dexprotector/assets/com.dexprotector.detector.envchecks.2.1.xapk).

Info

LiveNet’s protected assets (`zpoasosdi.dat, regtbeonuev.dat, and btylusqrepu.dat`) are serialized BouncyCastle keystores used to authenticate the application on the IPTV backend. Due to the sensitive nature of this identification, I took a different application to illustrate how this protection mechanism works.

This application contains a file named `assets/chinook.db`. While the extension suggests it is a database, the file is protected and the hexdump reveals high entropy data rather than a standard file header.

```hexdump

```

When DexProtector runs its initialization routine via `libdp.so`, it modifies the vtable of the internal class related to assets processing which is located in `libandroidfw.so`.

The modifications of the vtable are not trivial but the main idea is to intercept all the virtual calls from `android::_FileAsset::*`.

This interception occurs whenever the application attempts to access asset files using:

-   The Java API: `AssetManager.open()`
-   The Native API: `AAssetManager_open()`

When DexProtector intercepts these calls, it decrypts and potentially uncompress the underlying file on-the-fly, providing the clear content to the application.

The key and nonce required to decrypt the file are distributed across different elements, including the file header and a subkey derived from a master key. By recovering these elements, it is possible to decrypt the asset manually and reveal the original content.

```hexdump

Info

This file is actually not sensitive and it taken from [https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database)

The other mechanisms used by DexProtector to protect resources under the tags `<res>, <strings>` are similar but less sophisticated. They consist of hooking internal Android API like `android.content.res.StringBlock.{nativeGetString, nativeGetResourceStringArray}` and `android/content/res/AssetManager.nativeGetResourceIdentifier` to decrypt the protected content on-the-fly.

## RASP

DexProtector uses state-of-the-art RASP mechanisms that secure both its core and the application against tampering.

For instance, it bypasses the standard `PackageManager` API in favor of raw Binder communication to detect installed root-related packages (such as `com.zachspong.temprootremovejb`).

Developers can enable these protections using the following configuration:

```xml
<antiDebug>true</antiDebug>
<antiEmulator>true</antiEmulator>
<antiManualInstall>true</antiManualInstall>
<antiMalware>true</antiMalware>
<runtimeChecks/>
```

When DexProtector flags a threat (such as hooking), it typically records the detection and defers its reaction to a later point in the execution flow.

However, if a threat occurs very early during startup, it may trigger immediate countermeasures, such as corrupting the master key or terminating the application.

Despite these measures, these detections are susceptible to bypass and reverse engineering in a quasi-systematic way:

## Conclusion

DexProtector provides a post-build, no-code solution requiring minimal configuration by developers to protect their mobile applications. While this approach is appealing, it introduces a generic design that weakens the solution: successfully reverse engineering one instance of DexProtector enables a scalable attack on all applications protected by this tool (see [Annexes](#annexes)).

Although DexProtector uses a highly context-sensitive approach to derive cryptographic material, this is insufficient to prevent key recovery and access protected assets.

DexProtector remains a good solution for protecting assets and IP but its limitations must be weighed against the sensitivity of the content being secured.
